# Docker Compose Project

This project uses Docker Compose to set up and run a multi-container application. The setup is designed to make development and deployment consistent, scalable, and easy to manage.

## Features

- **Multi-container setup**: Runs multiple services together (e.g., app server and database).
- **Easy environment configuration**: Manage environment variables for different settings.
- **Data persistence**: Uses volumes to retain data across container restarts.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables** (Optional):
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the required values.

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will:
   - Build the required images.
   - Start the containers as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
   - Run in detached mode (`-d`), so you can close the terminal without stopping the containers.

4. **Access the Application**:
   - Access the main application at `http://localhost:<your-port>` (adjust based on your appâ€™s setup).
   - If applicable, access other services (like databases) via ports defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Useful Commands

- **Stop the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

- **View logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

- **Rebuild services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Your main application code.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines services, networks, and volumes for the app.
- `.env`: Environment variables configuration (not included in the repo for security).

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add a feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
